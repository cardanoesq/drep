    "bio": "In 2020, I was inspired to combine my passions for Cardano and the law. Having recently completed my Juris Doctor, I aim to contribute to Cardano as an attorney (pending 2025 Wyoming bar exam). As a DRep, my objective is to support and safeguard Cardano for current and future generations. My decision-making process is informed by a decade of experience in the military, federal law enforcement, and regulatory compliance.",

    "objectives": "(1) Promote long-term vision over short-term benefits\n(2) Balance treasury use and preservation\n(3) Encourage transparent, collaborative funding processes. Unexpected treasury withdrawal governance actions necessitate heightened scrutiny\n(4) Assert that governance action proposers bear the burden of proof — demonstrating alignment with Cardano's long-term interest. The standard increases with cost and potential impact. Proposers must objectively articulate benefits and drawbacks — coherent arguments for why, on balance, the action should be ratified\n(5) Leverage critical thinking and reasoned decision-making methodologies. I seek out information, weigh available evidence, then arrive at provisional conclusions — adjusted by overriding evidence and arguments. Nontechnical and technical matters, alike.\n(6) Transparently uphold specific tenets of ethical conduct. I'll provide a comprehensive list of ethical commitments and means for their implementation prior to Chang+1",
    "qualifications": "(Education) Bachelor of Science from The U.S. Military Academy at West Point in American Legal Studies, Counterterrorism, Systems Engineering; Master of Professional Studies from Pennsylvania State University in Homeland Security, Geospatial Intelligence; Juris Doctor and Intellectual Property Graduate Certificate from UNH Franklin Pierce School of Law\n(Certifications) Cardano Blockchain Certified Associate, Certified Fraud Examiner, Certified Cryptocurrency Forensic Investigator\n(Cardano) Community member since 2020; Chicagoland and Las Vegas DRep Pioneer Workshops; Las Vegas Constitutional Workshop; Will attend Chicago and Fort Myers Constitutional Workshops, Cardano Summit\n(Experience) U.S. Army Officer, accountable for my soldiers and $30M+ in sensitive military equipment, held a Top Secret/SCI clearance; Federal Regulatory Investigator for the U.S. Department of Labor, led 112 investigations covering nine federal statutes, recovered $1.96M+ in unpaid wages and associated penalties.",
    "motivations": "Decentralized self-governance represents a paradigm shift in how people and institutions interact. Cardano offers the promise of a superior substrate: decentralized global infrastructure hosting identity, value, and governance. In the near term, it can positively influence traditional institutions. In the long-term, it could transform or displace them.\nMy primary motivation is the beneficial impact this could have on future generations. For my daughters, for their children, onwards.\n \nWe need a diverse range of DReps, each enriching the collective decision-making process through their unique perspectives. To that end, with Cardano's long-term success as my focus, I'm excited for the opportunity to offer my knowledge, experience, and resulting insights as a DRep.\nPlease note: DRep delegation creates no professional relationship or fiduciary duty. I act in a personal capacity, not as a legal or financial advisor. Delegators are responsible for their own decisions and compliance.",
